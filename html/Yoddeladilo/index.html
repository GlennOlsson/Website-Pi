        End the long discussions today!
<br><br>
        Are you constantly having discussions with your friends over how to pronounce certain words? Or is it your cat and yourself that are arguing over how you are supposed to spread butter on your sandwich? Whatever it is, this can now all be settled! With Yoddeladilo, you can ask polls to everyone around the globe, to which everyone can anonymously respond to. The numbers will talk for themselves, and you can finally stop discussing these subjects! (Except if you are correct of course, then you should mention it at least twice every time you see each other)

        If you need to get in contact with the developer, send an <a href="mailto:glennol@kth.se">email</a> and I will help you
        from there
